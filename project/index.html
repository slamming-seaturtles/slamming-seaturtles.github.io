				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>I'm Sam. I am a sophomore Marine Science major. I've got two dogs (one of them doesn't live with me currently) and two cats. I am trying to find my own place to live as I am currently living with my parents 30 minutes away from Columbia. I was an average A/B student throughout grade school and managed to graduate high school with a 4.6 GPA. Some things about me: I have a bit of a spending problem except when I know that I'm tight on money, I hyperfixate on things often and then drop them suddenly, and I say I read a lot but I really don't... I do enjoy reading though.</p>
				<p id="second-paragraph" class="hidden"> I'm from a military family, so I've moved around more than the average person. I've lived in Mississippi, Missouri and South Carolina. I was born in Mississippi in the middle of November 2002, but have been living in South Carolina for about 10 years. Growing up, I went to 5 different elementary schools, 3 middle schools, and 1 high school. This used to be my personality, not going to lie, especially going through middle school in a small town where no one travels outside the state much.</p>

				<h2>My Future Career Plans</h2>
				<p>I am still trying to figure out my set career path, but the plan was to go into marine mammal/reptile rehabilitation. This was changed suddenly when I began taking Marine Science classes at the University of South Carolina and found out most were lab based classes. I wasn't one to want to do research, but in the past 2 years, I've learned to love it. </p>
				<p id="other-paragraph" class="hidden">Now, I'm just focusing on figuring out graduate school plans and contemplating my plans for my careers. Rehabilitation has been my dream since I was a kid, but being able to learn more through research is also very appealing.</p>
